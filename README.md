# Hello, dear GitHub users!  

I'm **Dante Besfalin**, and I present to you the **landing page** of a website about *"programming courses"*.  

### Why only the landing page?  
To keep it short, this project had been sitting in my VKontakte files since 2022. Recently, I decided to open it and see what I was capable of back then. To say the least, I was surprised! But now, with more experience, Iâ€™ve made some improvements to the page.  

### What's been done:  
- Made the `header` elements symmetrical.  
- Adapted font sizes for the first time.  
- Added a modal window with a fun close button.  
- Implemented opening and closing functionality with **JavaScript**.  

### About the author:  
I am a **developer with a disability**, working with **pure code** on a regular **Android tablet**. I use **SPCK Editor for NodeJS** for development.
